# CMSC22-Project
This project was made in fulfillment of my CMSCC22 class (Object-oriented Programming). This whole project is written in Java (JDK 14) and applies the basics of the programming language. This project used 3 design patterns: bridge, builder and strategy. Java programming standards and practices were applied to the best of the coder's ability to ensure that other Java programmers can understand, use, and edit the source code. Test-driven development was used to develop this program.

This project makes to-do lists according to 3 categories: Academics, Chores, and Personal things. To create an Academics to-do list, simply instantiate the AcademicsToDoList object with the 'new' keyword and run the createList() method to create a to-do list. The same goes for chores and personal to-do lists. All 3 classes have the same 6 methods that they inherited from the ListBuilder and ToDoListBuilder abstract classes. Although the methods are similar between the 3 'to-do list' classes, they each display different messages according to the context. There is also a Demo class provided to show the user how the program can be used. The JavaDoc files and executable JAR file are also provided. 

Some coding practices incorporated:
- Always using brackets even if not required
- Writing code right after the closing bracket
- Using spaces between operators and operands
- Using appropriate annotations
- Using camel case (camelCase) for method names, parameters, and fields and pascal case (PascalCase) for class names
